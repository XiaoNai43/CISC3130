# Movie Titles

There is a business owner who wants to know which movies titles have been released. In order to do so he needs to know more about movies produced and has a copy of data from the MovieLens project.

The data comes from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

## Dependencies

## Setup

These are the steps to compile and run `MyApp.java`.
The Source code is available in the `src` folder.
These steps are for use with command line workflow such as with a terminal.

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/MAzhar43/AssignmentThree.git` to your machine to get a copy.
2. Move into the project's root directory with `cd src`
3. Compile the java file using the java compiler command `javac MyApp.java`
4. Run the compiled java program with the java command `java MyApp`
